# Repository Rules — Scribex Editor

This document explains how this repository is protected and the exact steps every contributor must follow to participate.

---

## Who can push directly?

**Only the repository owner (@mirzasaikatahmmed) can push directly to `main`.**

All other contributors — no matter their experience level — must go through a Pull Request. Direct pushes from external accounts are blocked by GitHub branch protection rules.

---


## Contributor Workflow

Every contributor must follow these 5 steps in order.

### Step 1 — Star the repository

Click the **Star** button at the top-right of the repository page.

This shows support for the project and helps others discover it.

### Step 2 — Fork the repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of the repository page.

GitHub will create a full copy of the repository under **your own account**:

```
https://github.com/<your-username>/scribex-editor
```

You own this fork — you can do anything inside it without affecting the original.

### Step 3 — Clone your fork locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/scribex-editor.git
cd scribex-editor
```

Add the original repository as an upstream remote so you can stay in sync:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mirzasaikatahmmed/scribex-editor.git
```

Verify your remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/<your-username>/scribex-editor.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/<your-username>/scribex-editor.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/mirzasaikatahmmed/scribex-editor.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/mirzasaikatahmmed/scribex-editor.git (push)
```

### Step 4 — Create a branch and make your changes

Never work directly on `main`. Create a dedicated branch:

```bash
# Pull the latest changes from upstream first
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name upstream/main
```

Make your changes, then build and verify:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit    # check for TypeScript errors
```

Commit using the project's emoji convention:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✨ feat: describe what you added"
```

Push your branch to **your fork** (not the original):

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

### Step 5 — Open a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub: `https://github.com/<your-username>/scribex-editor`
2. Click the **Compare & pull request** button that appears after your push
3. Set the base repository to `mirzasaikatahmmed/scribex-editor` and base branch to `main`
4. Fill in the PR description:
   - What did you change?
   - Why did you change it?
   - How did you test it?
5. Click **Create pull request**

The maintainer (@mirzasaikatahmmed) will review, leave feedback if needed, and merge when it's ready.

---

## Keeping your fork up to date

Before starting any new contribution, sync your fork with the latest upstream changes:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

This prevents merge conflicts when you open your PR.

---

## What happens if you try to push directly?

If you attempt to push directly to the `mirzasaikatahmmed/scribex-editor` repository without going through a PR, GitHub will reject it:

```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/main.
remote: error: Required status check "build" is required.
To https://github.com/mirzasaikatahmmed/scribex-editor.git
 ! [remote rejected] main -> main (protected branch hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs
```

This is expected behaviour. Follow the fork → branch → PR workflow above.
